Explanation:
In the refactored code, we introduced a new class called `LegacyLibrary` that represents the legacy library with a different interface. Then, we implemented an adapter class called `LegacyLibraryAdapter` that inherits from the `NewLibrary` class (the desired interface) and wraps the `LegacyLibrary` object. The adapter class implements the same interface as the `NewLibrary` class and delegates the method calls to the corresponding methods in the `LegacyLibrary` object.

The `LegacyLibraryAdapter` acts as a bridge between the desired interface (`NewLibrary`) and the legacy library (`LegacyLibrary`). It adapts the method calls from the new library interface to the legacy library interface.

The `ClientCode` class remains unchanged and interacts with the library through the adapter, `LegacyLibraryAdapter`. This allows the client code to work seamlessly with the legacy library using the desired interface.

By using the Adapter design pattern, we achieve compatibility between incompatible interfaces and enable the client code to interact with the legacy library without modifications. The adapter acts as a translator, converting the method calls from the desired interface to the corresponding calls in the legacy library.

This refactoring improves the code by decoupling the client code from the specifics of the legacy library interface, making it easier to maintain and enhance the system. It also promotes code reuse by allowing the client code to work with different library implementations through adapters.
